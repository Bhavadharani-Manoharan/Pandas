📦 E-Commerce Data Analysis Project



Exploring Online Retail Dataset using Python \& Pandas



📌 Project Overview

This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an E-Commerce Online Retail dataset using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

The goal is to understand customer purchasing patterns, stock-keeping unit (SKU) performance, sales trends, and data quality issues within transactional retail data.



The analysis covers data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and generating meaningful insights that help stakeholders make data-driven business decisions.



🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project include:

✔ 1. Data Exploration

* Explore the structure of the dataset
* View samples, shape, column details, data types, and missing values



✔ 2. Data Cleaning

* Handle missing or incorrect entries
* Remove duplicates
* Fix negative quantities and invalid prices
* Manage outliers and inconsistent invoice information



✔ 3. Sales \& Customer Insights

* Identify top-selling products
* Find most valuable customers
* Analyze country-based sales distribution
* Detect seasonal and hourly purchasing patterns



✔ 4. Visualization \& Reporting

* Create charts for sales trends
* Plot product frequency
* Visualize customer distribution
* Present insights clearly for business review
